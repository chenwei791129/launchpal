# Spectra Instructions

This project uses Spectra for Spec-Driven Development(SDD). Specs live in `openspec/specs/`, change proposals in `openspec/changes/`.

## Skills

Each `/spectra-*` skill carries its own trigger description; these are the groups:

- Shape and plan → `/spectra-discuss`, `/spectra-propose`
- Continue tasks for an identified change → `/spectra-apply`
- Update requirements or plans for an identified change → `/spectra-ingest`
- Quality gate → `/spectra-verify`, `/spectra-review`, `/spectra-analyze`, `/spectra-audit`, `/spectra-drift`, `/spectra-debug`
- Finish → `/spectra-archive`, `/spectra-commit`

Explicit skill invocation takes precedence. Apply existing authorization within its unchanged scope.

## Workflow

discuss? → propose → apply ⇄ ingest → verify / review → archive

- `discuss` is optional — skip if requirements are clear
- Requirements change mid-work? Plan mode → `ingest` → resume `apply`

## Parked Changes

Changes can be parked（暫存）— temporarily moved out of `openspec/changes/`. Parked changes won't appear in `spectra list` but can be found with `spectra list --parked`. To restore: `spectra unpark <name>`. The `/spectra-apply` and `/spectra-ingest` skills disclose parking and restore when the named operation is already explicitly requested; respect a known refusal, otherwise ask for missing authorization.

## Issue & Release Policy

- Do NOT close GitHub issues until the release PR workflow is complete and merged.
- When implementation is done, update the issue with a comment summarizing the changes, but leave it open.
- Issues are closed as part of the release process, not at implementation time.

## Post-Implementation Checklist

Every time a feature is added, modified, or removed, check whether the following files need updating:

- `README.md` — Features list, screenshots, known limitations
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` — Directory structure, service capabilities, known limitations
- `CLAUDE.md` — This file (if workflow or tooling changes)
